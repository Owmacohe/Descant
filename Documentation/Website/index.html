        <strong>Descant</strong> is a <strong>Unity</strong> dialogue system plugin. The
        <strong><a href="https://assetstore.unity.com">Unity Asset Store</a></strong> is
        <a href="https://github.com/owmacohe/Descant/Documentation/system_review.xlsx">chock full</a> of many such
        types of plugins, ranging from <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/behavior-ai/dialogue-system-for-unity-11672">feature-rich</a>,
        to <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/visual-scripting/conversa-dialogue-system-192549">ultra-minimalist</a>,
        to <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/c5-dialogue-system-14881">downright bad</a>.
        <strong>Descant</strong> aims to hit the sweet spot between quality UI, powerful features, and easy-to-lean
        functionality, while also addressing many of the game-specific consequences of the standard dialogue manager
        setup. Besides acting as a standard tool for creating, saving, and actualizing non-linear game dialogue, it
        also pushes the envelope by adding optional dialogue-enhancing node components that introduce features to break
        away from the overused and underwhelming trends seen in many interactive fiction games. These enhancements act
        similar to <strong>Unity</strong>'s standard <strong>GameObject Component</strong> system, and can be applied
        at-will to nodes. This modular approach is so-far not explored in the world of Unity dialogue systems. The
        project will be free <em>(and collaborative open-source)</em> forever. Feel free to send me a message or submit
        a pull request if you want to make any changes.

      <h2>Component documentation</h2>
      <p>
        A number of Descant Components come bundled with the system by default. They cover a wide range of
        applications, and can be edited at-will. Please see the next section, <strong>Component creation</strong>, for
        a guide on how to write your own Components in C#.

      <h2>Component creation</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Create a new C# class in <strong>Descant/Components/Custom</strong>.</li>
        <li>Make sure that the Component is in the <strong>DescantComponents</strong> namespace.</li>
        <li>Make sure that the Component inherits from the <strong>DescantComponent</strong> abstract class.</li>
        <li>Add a <strong>[Serializable]</strong> attribute to the Component.</li>
        <li>
          Add a <strong>[MaxQuantity(...)]</strong> attribute to the Component (replace the '...' with the maximum number
          of Components of this type that can be added to a single node) ('...' can be <strong>float.PositiveInfinity</strong>).
        </li>
        <li>
          Add a <strong>[NodeType(...)]</strong> attribute to the Component (replace the '...' with the
          <strong>DescantNodeType</strong> indicating which types of nodes it can be added to).
        </li>
        <li>
          Add any number of public variables/properties to the Component (these properties will show up in
          the <strong>Descant Graph Editor</strong> when you add the Component to a node) (you may also create
          private/protected properties, but they won't appear in the editor). Properties may only be of type
          <strong>int</strong>, <strong>float</strong>, <strong>string</strong>, <strong>bool</strong>, or
          <strong>enum</strong> (<strong>VariableType</strong>, <strong>ComparisonType</strong>,
          <strong>OperationType</strong>, or <strong>ListChangeType</strong> <strong>enum</strong>s only).
        </li>
        <li>
          For each public variable, add either an <strong>[Inline]</strong> attribute (indicating that it will be
          visually nestled beside the Component name in the editor) or a <strong>[ParameterGroup(...)]</strong>
          attribute (indicating that it will be visually arranged in a new group beneath the Component name in the
          editor) (replace the '...' with the string name of the group to order it into).
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Optional: By default, all Component fields filter any out most special characters on input. You can
          override this by giving any public variable a <strong>[NoFiltering]</strong> attribute, disabling filtering
          for that variable's corresponding field in the <strong>Descant Graph Editor</strong>. This is useful for
          long-form fields that may have sentence grammar and punctuation.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          If this Component performs some action when it is reached during dialogue, give it the following method:
          <strong>public override DescantNodeInvokeResult Invoke(DescantNodeInvokeResult result)</strong>. The
          <strong>DescantNodeInvokeResult</strong> object being passed contains all the choice/response text for the
          current node, the current actors, and info regarding the actor portraits) (see the
          <a href="https://github.com/Owmacohe/Descant/blob/main/Components/DescantNodeInvokeResult.cs">DescantNodeInvokeResult</a>
          class for more info). The <strong>Invoke</strong> method must return a <strong>DescantNodeInvokeResult</strong>
          object (almost always just <strong>result</strong> itself, with its properties modified).
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Optional: Many of the default Components require actor names to know which actors' properties to check.
          If your Component must also access a <strong>DescantActor</strong>, make sure that it has a <strong>public
          string ActorName</strong> variable, then get access to the actor with
          <strong>DescantComponentUtilities.GetActor(this, result.Actors, ActorName)</strong>.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Optional: Many default Descant Components only do their effect if some comparison is made. Should your
            Component also wish to do so, the <strong>CompareVariable</strong> method in
            <a href="https://github.com/Owmacohe/Descant/blob/main/Components/DescantComponent.cs">DescantComponent</a>
            may be of use.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Optional: If you need the Component to do something continuously while it is active during dialogue, give
          it one of the following methods: <strong>public override bool FixedUpdate()</strong> or <strong>public
          override bool Update()</strong>. They function in exactly the same manner as the classic <strong>MonoBehaviour</strong>
          methods of the same names, save for the fact that if they ever return <strong>false</strong>, the dialogue
          ends immediately (should the Component want to end the dialogue for some reason).</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          That's it! Your new Component will now show up as an option to add to a node in the <strong>Descant Graph
          Editor</strong>.
        </li>
