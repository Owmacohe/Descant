## Monday, October 9^th^

The base system has finally been settled! I have the Editor script all done (save for a few QOL or functionality tweaks), the saving works pretty well, and I’m now getting started on the Runtime scripts. While I do that, I’ll be working on the unique aspects of Descant. That’s where the real creativity will start to shine through, and I’ll be journalling a lot more (I hope). Presently I’m going to try writing one of these journals every 2-3 commits. To coincide with my general pattern of milestones. I’ll also be ramping up my explanations in commit messages, going beyond the standard dry descriptions of changes.

I’m nearing the proof-of-concept milestone that I played out for myself originally. I’m feeling good about my progress, though I know that the ‘components’ system that I had dreamed up will take some finagling to get working. I think that my next steps for the project are to make a ‘build’ of the current package, build a super simple runtime testing interface, then get going on the ‘components’ system. On Jonathan’s recommendation, I’ll also try to classify and narrow my sights down to just 2-3 for each of the node, graph, and actor scopes. I’ll be doing that soon too I hope.
