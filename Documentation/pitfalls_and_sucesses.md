## Pitfalls

- Sameness in choices / Repetitious dialogue
- Clicking fatigue / Ask-everyone-about-everything tedium
- Unchanging NPCs
- Adventure-style text-parsers are too slow and convoluted



## Successes

- Mechanics

  - Physical interaction during dialogue
  - Dedicated button directions for types of responses
  - Conversation recaps
  - Exposing the workings of the system for clarity (e.g. showing NPC mood)
  - Limited number of total choices an NPC can be asked
  - “News events”, their radii, spread, and evolution

- Players

  - Conversation-specific

    - Timed choices
    - Unchoices
    - Failure as success
    - Conversation interruptions (+ returns to conversation & queueing vs. interjecting)

  - Conversation-independent

    - Conversation tone choice

    - Collecting nouns and asking NPCs about said nouns
    - Stats/afflictions governing what players can say

    - Entirely different dialogue choices based on class/stats

    - Culture-influenced dialects

- NPCs

  - NPC ability to remember knowledge
  - Responsive choices to player statements
  - NPC purposes
  - Culture-influenced dialects
