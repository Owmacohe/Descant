## Overview

**Descant** is a **Unity** dialogue system plugin. The [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com) is [chock full](Documentation/system_review.xlsx) of many such types of plugins, ranging from [feature-rich](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/behavior-ai/dialogue-system-for-unity-11672), to [ultra-minimalist](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/visual-scripting/conversa-dialogue-system-192549), to [downright bad](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/c5-dialogue-system-14881). **Descant** aims to hit the sweet spot between quality UI, powerful features, and easy-to-lean functionality, while also addressing many of the game-specific consequences of the standard dialogue manager setup. Besides acting as a standard tool for creating, saving, and actualizing non-linear game dialogue, I also aim to take it forward by adding optional ‘dialogue enhancements’ that introduce features to break away from the overused and underwhelming trends seen in many interactive fiction games. These enhancements would act similar to **Unity**’s standard `GameObject` `Component` system, and could be applied at-will to nodes, characters within the conversation, and the conversation itself. This modular approach is so-far not explored in the world of Unity dialogue systems. The project will be free *(and hopefully collaborative open-source)* forever.
